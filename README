NAME
	Force Schemas

SYNOPSIS
	A simple tool to enforce current retention policies and schemas 
	for your Graphite installation.

	High Level Overview:
	- Grab all schema info as set in $GRAPHITE_BASE/$STORGE_SCHEMAS
	- Run through all Whisper databases as defined in $GRAPHITE_BASE/$STORAGE_PATH
	- Run /usr/bin/whisper-info.py against them
	- Match the database's name with the storage schema
	- If the schema is up to date, nothing happens, otheriwse it runs /usr/bin/whisper-resize.py against it

        over correctly, be sure to delete all of them!
